Sentimental: Converting older pset challenges' C code to python code 


Similarities(less): Finds similar lines/ sentences/ substrings in two text files. 
The challenge was just to implement helpers.py and index.html specifically. 
Of note: 
1. The difference between splitlines() and split("\n"). The former returns an empty list for the empty string, and a terminal line break does not result in an extra line.
2. Using getElementById() Method + removeAttributes() Method to have a disabled number input enabled only if radio button is clicked.
