# cs50
My current progress on the CS50 course
https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/

Note:
Some of the implementations may not be according to specs, as they are not intended for submission. 
For instance, the python script for Greedy gives out individual amount of quarters, dimes, pennies, etc, rather than the number of coins overall.
