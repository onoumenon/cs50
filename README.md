# Harvard CS50: Intro to Computer Science
My current progress on the CS50 2018 course
https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/


Note:
Some of the implementations may not be according to specs, as they are not intended for submission. 
For instance, my script for Greedy gives out individual amount of quarters, dimes, pennies, etc, rather than the number of coins overall.
However, all uploaded scripts are fully functional.

I will also be uploading lesson notes and walkthroughs to my blog:
