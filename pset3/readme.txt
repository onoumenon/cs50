This pset has 4 parts:

1. Learn to read sheet music.

2. Learn to read code.

3. Convert musical notes to frequencies.

4. Synthesize songs.

The code uploaded synthesizes songs into wav files from text files transcribed from sheet music. 

The text files for songs are not included, but they look like this:
C4@1/4
C4@1/4
C4@1/8
D4@1/8
...



Most of the code (ie: converting text files into wav) have been provided, and I only needed to complete the implementation of helpers.c, which determines how different notes have different frequencies based on an algorithm.
